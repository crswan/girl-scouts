	<h1>Aide Expectations and Responsibilities </h1>

	

<ol>

  <li><b>A positive attitude is the most important quality of a good Aide. </b><br />

    I 

  will exhibit cheerfulness and enthusiasm at all times especially during kapers, 

  cooking, first thing in the morning, and last thing at night. When events do 

  not go according to plan, I will not panic, but will have a calm and accepting 

  attitude so as to influence the campers in a positive way. I understand that 

  my attitude is the most important thing I have to offer and has more impact on 

  the campers than any other staff member. </li>

  <li><b>I will use language that is supportive to the campers.<br />

</b>I will be 

  careful not to use slang loosely as the campers and other staff members can 

  easily misinterpret it. I will try to keep this in mind and think first before 

  I speak. I understand that sarcasm has no place in Camp. </li>

  <li><b>I will try to treat all the campers equally and fairly. <br />

  </b>I will 

  refrain from playing favorites or discriminating in any way. I will handle 

  clinging campers gently and without sarcasm. I will support all of the 

  campers' efforts equally no matter how small or insignificant the attempt may 

  be. I understand that all campers have the right to a successful experience at 

  Day Camp and that how I communicate and offer my friendship is a key factor in 

  that success. </li>

  <li><b>I will make every attempt to encourage and allow the campers to do for 

  themselves. <br />

  </b>I will not take over their tasks be it a craft or a chore, but 

  will help support, and encourage them to do for themselves in order for 

  success and independence to grow. </li>

  <li><b>I will exhibit respect for the campers and unit leaders in the way I 

  communicate. <br />

  </b>I will listen to suggestions calmly and respectfully 

  communicate my problems to my unit leaders or to my aide Advisor if necessary. 

  I will express my concerns as soon as possible to an appropriate adult. </li>

  <li><b>I will be a good example to campers by participating enthusiastically 

  in all activities, kapers and projects.<br />

</b>I will follow all the rules of Day 

  Camp and thus be a good role model at all times. </li>

  <li><b>I realize that my role in a unit will be to help teach the campers 

  songs, games, skills, nature, and all other aspects of camp life. </b><br />

  I accept 

  being part of the unit staff as a different responsibility than being a 

  camper. In this capacity, I will try to be sensitive to the needs of the 

  campers and the unit leaders. </li>

  <li><b>I will treat my fellow Aides as part of a team working together for the 

  success of everyone at Camp.<br />

</b>I will share everything possible, including 

  but not limited to my skills, knowledge of camp life, friendship, 

  responsibilities, and cooperation. These attitudes will be extended to include 

  the Aide overnight including sharing food, chores, and other projects. </li>

  <li><b>I will behave in a cheerful, positive and mature fashion, showing 

  leadership, responsibility, cooperation and knowledge as expected of an Aide 

  at Peninsula Girl Scout Day Camp. </b></li>

</ol>

<p><i>The expectations and responsibilities listed above are a compilation of 

brainstorming sessions held at Huddart Park Aide Training on May 8, 1999. All 

Aides present participated in this discussion and agreed that these are 

important parameters to follow at Day Camp.</i></p>
