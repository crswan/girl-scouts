	<h1>Who can come to camp?</h1>
	<h2>Girls entering first grade can register as campers and attend camp with or without a volunteer.</h2>
<p>Peninsula Day Camp enrolls girls, aides-in-training, and aides in grades 1-12.  

	  You don't even need to be a Girl Scout!    

	<p> Boys and younger children of camp staff can come to camp too, on the days when Mom or Dad are working at camp.  It's a great way to provide a real camp experience for younger kids.

    <h2>Daisy, Brownie and Junior Units      </h2>

	  <blockquote>

	    <p>Girls entering 1st-5th grades. Campers are grouped by age in units of 16 - 18 girls with two adult leaders and two aides. Campers stay overnight on the last night of camp.        </p>

    </blockquote>

	  <h2><a name="olderGirls" id="olderGirls"></a>Older Girl Units      </h2>

        <p>Each year we offer a variety of themed units to older girls. Available choices may vary from year to year, but here's a sampling of themes for this year:</p>

            <li><strong>Skarts</strong> - Try out archery or make a gum ball machine. Enjoy a well rounded camp program - a little arts, a little skills, a little nature and a lot of fun. Perfect for the camper who likes everything.</li>

            <li><strong>AIT&rsquo;s</strong> - &amp; perfect the four basic outdoor skills. Learn teaching methods. Review appropriate songs &amp; games and learn to teach younger campers.

          </ul>

        </ul>

        <p><strong>Pioneers</strong> and <strong>Backpackers</strong> stay overnight for three nights; AITs and other older-girl units stay overnight for two nights.</p>
        <p>* The Aides in Training unit is for girls entering 9th grade. It is a transition year between attending as a regular camper and becoming an aide. At the last-night campfire, AITs &quot;graduate&quot; and receive their Aide T-shirt (with their very own camp name.)</p>

	  <h3>Save the date for

	    the 2009 older-girl meeting!</h3>

        <h2>Choosing your older-girl unit </h2>

        <p>Any registered girl entering 6th grade and up will receive a letter inviting her to the annual Older-Girl meeting, where she will learn about this year's unit choices and get to choose her  unit.  At that meeting we go over all the different unit options, the girls meet some of the unit leaders and see some of the projects, then they fill out a request sheet and list their top 3 unit choices in order. We also have a section at the bottom (that we carefully explain) where they can list a friend's name and we ask them very specifically if it is more important to be in their first unit choice or is it more important to be with a friend.  Then if there is any confusion on our part we call each of the girls and confirm.  So being with a friend shouldn't be a problem, but whoever the friend is, the girls have to choose the same unit. </p>

    </blockquote>

	  

      <h2>Aides</h2>

      <blockquote>

        <p>For girls and boys 10th grade and up. See our <a href="aides/index.html">aides page</a> for more information. </p>

        <p> Many of our staff started coming to camp as children and never stopped.      

          Campers look forward to the year when they'll be old enough to become  aides. 

          At the last-night campfire each year, our 9th grade Aides in Training have a &quot;graduation&quot; ceremony during which they receive their aide T-shirts with their  own <a href="camp_names.html">camp name</a> on the back.        </p>

      </blockquote>

      <h2>Younger Children and Boys</h2>

	  <blockquote>

	    <p>Your Pixies and Boys are welcome to attend camp
