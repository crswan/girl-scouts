		<h2>IMPORTANT NOTICE </h2>

		<p><strong>Peninsula Day camp expects that your child will arrive and depart camp by their assigned bus.  Should you make other arrangements, those arrangements are not the responsibility of Peninsula Girl Scout Day Camp or Girl Scouts of Northern California.

</strong></p>
		<p><strong>We thank you for your cooperation with our transportation procedures.  Together we can assure the safety of all our campers.

      <h1>Transportation to Camp</h1>

      <p>Peninsula Day Camp provides free  bus service to Huddart Park. Aides and &quot;bus moms&quot; ride with the girls and lead their favorite camp songs, so the  ride to Huddart Park each day becomes a memorable and fun part of your daughter's camp experience. </p>

      <p>Children of full-time at-camp volunteers are expected to ride to/from camp in a private

        vehicle.&nbsp; All other campers are expected to ride the bus.</p>

      <h2>Buses</h2>

      <p>Campers are assigned to a specific bus (see <strong><a href="buses.html">bus schedules</a></strong> page). If you do not know your camper's bus name or bus stop location please contact the Administrator at

        [Debbie at peninsuladaycamp dot org]. Your camper must go to and from camp on the assigned bus<strong>.</strong></p>

      <h2><strong>Drop off and Pick up procedure: </strong></h2>

      <p>Please arrive at least 10 minutes before the bus is scheduled to arrive.  You must sign your camper in each morning with the bus stop monitor and sign her out each afternoon. </p>
      <p> If someone other than a parent or guardian is authorized to pick up your camper, please print the <a href="forms/Bus camper release .pdf">Camper Release form</a>, <strong>sign the form and give it to the Bus Monitor on the first day of camp</strong>.</p>

      <h2><strong>Missed the bus?</strong></h2>

    <p>The buses will not wait and are not legally allowed to pick anyone up other than at the designated loading site.  If you miss the bus and drive your camper to Huddart Park, you must sign her in at headquarters, located in the Oak Area.</p>
      <p>        If you will arrive at camp later than 9:30 or if your camper does not attend that day, you must call the <a href="contact.shtml#emergency_contact"><strong>emergency contact</strong></a>  and let us know she will not be attending.</p>
<h2><strong>If you are late to pick up your child from the bus stop: </strong></h2>

      <p>Bus stop monitors will remain in the bus area only 10 minutes after the scheduled bus arrival in the afternoon.  Any child not picked up within 10 minutes of the scheduled bus arrival time will remain in the care of the bus stop monitor while they leave and attend to their personal business.  If for some unavoidable reason, you are more than 10 minutes late to pick up your child, call the Camp Director, Sharon Torrano 650-678-4863, and she will let you know where to pick up your child.  <em><strong>We hope this procedure will not be necessary.</strong></em><strong></strong></p>

      <h2> Absences, Late Arrivals,  Early Departures </h2>

      <ul>

        <li>If  your camper will be absent or arrive late for any reason, please

          notify camp the day before in writing. For last-minute absences or changes, please call the camp <a href="contact.shtml#emergency_contact">emergency contact</a>  before 9am. </li>

        <li>If your

          camper needs to arrive or leave in the middle of the day, you must check her/him in or out at Camp Headquarters.

          It takes approximately 20 minutes to sign a child out and pick them up, so please allow plenty of time.

          <p><a href="/directions.html">Driving directions</a> </p>

        </li>

      </ul>

      <h2><strong>Overnight Luggage Tags</strong></h2>

      <p>A luggage tag, to attach to your overnight gear, will be available from the bus monitors during the second week of camp. Please make sure that it is clearly marked with your camper's name and unit number. This will help us to eliminate confusion and reunite campers with gear. </p>

      <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></p>

      <ul>

        <li><strong>DO NOT USE SOMEONE ELSE'S LUGGAGE TAG. </strong>There is a special tag for each bus. </li>

        <li>Your child will know her unit number after the first day at camp.</li>

        <li> The bus monitors will have luggage tags available during the second week of camp. Please pick up one when you sign your child on or off the bus.</li>
        <li> If your child is a &quot;Drive&quot;, they will get a luggage tag from their Unit Leader the second week.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2><strong>Last Day</strong></h2>

      <p>Your camper will be spending the night on second Thursday, (6th, 7th, 8th, &amp; 9th grade girls may also be spending additional nights at camp).  <strong>Therefore, there will be no bus service Thursday afternoon or Friday morning.</strong> The buses will leave camp at noon on Friday and return to the bus stops.</p>
      <p>Please remember buses may run a little late the last two days due to the loading and unloading of sleeping bags and overnight gear.</p>

	  <div class="box">

	  <h3>TIp</h3>

            <p>If your camper is being picked up from the bus stop by anyone but a parent, please turn in a camper release form (available on the <a href="forms/">forms</a> page) to the bus monitor. Please don't send it to the camp registrar!<br />
